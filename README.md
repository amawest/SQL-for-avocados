# Best Cities for Avocado Lovers
This script was created by me, Amanda West, on either the first or second day that I was started teaching myself SQL.

## About data
The data used was gotten from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices) and was posted by Justin Kiggins. I used 2018 data collected on March 25th. 

## About Project
This project was done solely on the IBM db2 Cloud. You can find the queries under queries.sql. 

SPOILER ALERT: It was Houston! [See why.](https://medium.com/@amawest/basic-sql-ranking-best-cities-for-avocado-lovers-f4813e2f012)
